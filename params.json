{"name":"TraceViewBundle","tagline":"A Symfony2 bundle for enhanced TraceView integration","body":"TraceViewBundle\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe `AppNeta\\TraceViewBundle` bundle provides additional information about Symfony2 components to AppNeta TraceView. It can currently support:\r\n\r\n- Reporting a controller and action\r\n- Tracking kernel events as layers\r\n- Tracking other event listeners as profiles\r\n- Tracking Twig template rendering as profiles\r\n\r\n# Installing\r\n\r\nFirst, you'll need to pull in the `TraceViewBundle` as one of your app's\r\ndependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Either use `composer require`,\r\nor in your `composer.json` file, modify the `\"require\"` section to include the bundle:\r\n```\r\n    \"require\": {\r\n        \"php\": \">=5.3.3\",\r\n        \"symfony/symfony\": \"~2.4\",\r\n        \"doctrine/orm\": \"~2.2,>=2.2.3\",\r\n        \"doctrine/doctrine-bundle\": \"~1.2\",\r\n        \"twig/extensions\": \"~1.0\",\r\n        [...]\r\n        \"appneta/traceview-bundle\": \"master@dev\" # Or whatever version you prefer.\r\n        [...]\r\n    },\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf installing directly from GitHub, rather than from Packagist, you can add the\r\nextra repository to your `composer.json` in a top-level key of `repositories`\r\nstructured like so:\r\n```\r\n    \"repositories\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"vcs\",\r\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/appneta/AppNetaTraceViewBundle\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter using Composer to pull in the bundle, you'll need to make it available to\r\nyour app. Add it to `app/AppKernel.php`, looking something like this:\r\n```\r\n    public function registerBundles()\r\n    {\r\n        $bundles = array(\r\n            new Symfony\\Bundle\\FrameworkBundle\\FrameworkBundle(),\r\n            new Symfony\\Bundle\\SecurityBundle\\SecurityBundle(),\r\n            new Symfony\\Bundle\\TwigBundle\\TwigBundle(),\r\n            [...]\r\n            new AppNeta\\TraceViewBundle\\TraceViewBundle(),\r\n            [...]\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        return $bundles;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo enable controller/action and event listener tracking, add this section to your `config.yml`:\r\n```\r\nservices:\r\n  event_dispatcher:\r\n    class: AppNeta\\TraceViewBundle\\EventDispatcher\\TraceViewContainerAwareEventDispatcher\r\n    arguments: ['@service_container']\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo enable Twig template tracking, add this line to the `twig` section of your `config.yml`:\r\n```\r\ntwig:\r\n    base_template_class: AppNeta\\TraceViewBundle\\Template\\TraceViewTwigTemplate\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Known issues\r\n\r\n- Friendlier controller/action name reporting for long or multiple controllers\r\n- Event dispatcher replacement currently conflicts with the Symfony debug toolbar\r\n- User-configurable settings for which dispatched events to whitelist/blacklist for tracking\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\nThe best way to improve this bundle is to work with the people using it! We\r\nactively encourage patches, pull requests, feature requests, and bug reports.\r\nCurrent goals include Symfony developer toolbar integration and performance or\r\narchitectural improvements where possible.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
